# LSTM-EZ
Flexible keras-based code to analyze sequence data using LSTM neural network. 
Illustrates the use of keras parameters such as "units" (= number of neurons), features and timesteps. 
The point is that if you have some sequence data and you want to quickly plug into anLSTM model 
(and you are frustrated by trying to follow Jason Brownlee's lovely but incomplete examples
https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#lstm) 
this will get you started quickly.
